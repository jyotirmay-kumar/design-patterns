# Design-Patterns
Project to learn and implement design patterns using Java


| Type of Design Pattern | Category   | Description | Key Features | Use Cases |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Singleton              | Creational | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. | Restricts instantiation to one object, provides a global access point, lazy initialization. | Logging, configuration settings, connection pools. |
| Factory Method         | Creational | Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. | Defines a method for object creation, but allows subclassing to specify the object type. | GUI frameworks, document generation, shape creation. |
| Abstract Factory       | Creational | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. | Creates related objects, often used in conjunction with factory methods. | Cross-platform applications, UI theme frameworks. |
| Builder                | Creational | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. | Step-by-step construction, allows creating different representations of the same type. | Complex object creation (e.g., building a car or a meal). |
| Prototype              | Creational | Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. | Object cloning, prototype pattern involves creating new objects from an existing prototype. | Object cloning, configuration objects, network protocols. |
| Adapter                | Structural | Converts one interface to another expected by the client. | Provides a way for incompatible interfaces to work together. | Integrating legacy systems, database connection libraries. |
| Bridge                 | Structural | Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. | Two-level abstraction, separating abstraction from implementation. | UI toolkits, device control systems, multi-platform applications. |
| Composite              | Structural | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. | Treats individual objects and composites uniformly, recursive structures. | File systems, organization structures, graphical elements. |
| Decorator              | Structural | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. | Adds new behavior without modifying existing code, flexible and extendable. | GUI components, streaming data, logging. |
| Facade                 | Structural | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. | Hides complexity by providing a simplified interface to clients. | Library integration, complex systems with many components. |
| Flyweight              | Structural | Reduces the number of objects created, sharing objects to support large numbers of similar objects. | Shares common data between objects, minimizes memory usage. | Text formatting, large-scale applications with repeating objects. |
| Proxy                  | Structural | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. | Control access, lazy initialization, caching, security. | Security proxies, virtual proxies, remote objects. |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Allows passing a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler can process the request or pass it along. | Decouples sender and receiver, allows multiple handlers to process a request. | Event handling systems, middleware, request processing pipelines. |
| Command                | Behavioral | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. | Requests as objects, decouples sender from receiver. | Undo/redo functionality, task scheduling, GUI controls. |
| Interpreter            | Behavioral | Provides a way to evaluate sentences in a language using a grammar. | Language interpretation, recursive structures, parsing. | Language processing, scripting engines, compilers. |
| Iterator               | Behavioral | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. | Iterates over objects, removes direct access to the collection's implementation. | Traversing collections, iterating over databases or lists. |
| Mediator               | Behavioral | Defines an object that controls how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling. | Centralized communication, reduces dependencies between objects. | Event-driven architectures, chat applications, GUI components. |
| Memento                | Behavioral | Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. | Saves the state of an object to restore it later without exposing the details. | Undo/redo functionality, version control, saving game states. |
| Observer               | Behavioral | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. | Event-driven, decouples the subject and observer, dynamic updates. | Event handling systems, GUI frameworks, notification systems. |
| State                  | Behavioral | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. | State-dependent behavior, context-switching without changing the object's code. | Workflow systems, game development, state machines. |
| Strategy               | Behavioral | Defines a family of algorithms and allows clients to choose which one to use. | Encapsulates algorithms, allows dynamic switching of behaviors. | Sorting algorithms, payment processing, routing algorithms. |
| Template Method        | Behavioral | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the method, allowing subclasses to implement specific steps. | Inherited method structure, subclasses override steps of the algorithm. | Game development, data processing pipelines, workflow management. |
| Visitor                | Behavioral | Allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. | Externalizes operations, enables adding new operations without altering object structure. | Compilers, object structure processing, tax calculation systems. |
